        <h2>ðŸ“œ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Sam, and I am extremely passionate about technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been working towards a role in technology for several years by studying Computer Science as part of my GCSEs, A-Levels, and finally as a degree at Swansea University (in which I achieved First Class Honours). I have also just completed a study year abroad at the University of Groningen, followed by a 12-week intensive-training course with La Fosse Academy. I believe all this, along with a general interest in the industry, has given me the tools I need to thrive in a role in technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I like to both make and play video games. I enjoy watching a variety of different sports, especially when with my friends and family. Whenever I get the chance, I love using and improving my problem-solving skills. This leads to me attending quizzes with friends and completing puzzles such as codewords and crosswords.
        </p>

        <p>
          On this page, I hope you are able to get a good understanding of what I'm all about. As you scroll down, you will see examples of projects I have completed using a whole host of different languages and technologies. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Pomodogo was developed over the course of a week with three other La Fosse Academy trainees. It uses a gamified pomodoro timer to help users stay focused and complete tasks. It also has cute animations which calms users and hopefully brings them joy.
