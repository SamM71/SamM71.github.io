        <h2>ðŸ“œ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Sam, and I am extremely passionate about technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have been working towards a role in technology for several years by studying Computer Science as part of my GCSEs, A-Levels, and finally as a degree at Swansea University (in which I achieved First Class Honours). I have also just completed a study year abroad at the University of Groningen, followed by a 12-week intensive-training course with La Fosse Academy. I believe all this, along with a general interest in the industry, has given me the tools I need to thrive in a role in technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time, I like to both make and play video games. I enjoy watching a variety of different sports, especially when with my friends and family. Whenever I get the chance, I love using and improving my problem-solving skills. This leads to me attending quizzes with friends and completing puzzles such as codewords and crosswords.
        </p>

        <p>
          On this page, I hope you are able to get a good understanding of what I'm all about. As you scroll down, you will see examples of projects I have completed using a whole host of different languages and technologies.

        <h2>Culturify</h2>
        <p>
          Culturify was developed over 2 weeks with four other La Fosse Academy trainees. It is a culinary social media app aiming to bring people from different cultures together through the medium of food.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution: <br> I spent most of my time developing the Flask backend. This consisted of creating the numerous routes for the application, writing automated tests, and structuring the database. <br> In the React frontend, I ensured that data was received from the backend for various parts of the application. I also created the forms to post new recipes and share them as posts.

        <h2>Pomodogo</h2>
        <p>
          Pomodogo was developed over the course of a week with three other La Fosse Academy trainees. It uses a gamified pomodoro timer to help users stay focused and complete tasks. It also has cute animations which calms users and hopefully brings them joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution: <br> I mainly worked on the frontend as I wanted to improve my React and CSS skills. As a result, I developed the functionality for the Pomodoro timer, which included getting the animations to behave exactly as we wanted in each scenario.

        <h2>Geo Quiz</h2>
        <p>
          Geo Quiz was developed in a week as part of a 4-person team. This educational site has 3 quizzes which should help users to learn more about the countries of the world in a fun and interactive way. The leaderboard section gives users the incentive to keep learning so that they can better their score. There is also a flashcard section in which users can learn about random countries without any time contraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution: <br> I predominantly worked on the backend and the implementation of all the game features. I also added the functionality to the leaderboard.

        <h2>Shape Invaders</h2>
        <p>
          Shape Invaders was made during a game jam in 2023. The theme was "life in 2 dimensions". The aim of the of the game is to destroy as many of the hostile shapes as possible. You need to use the blue bullet to shoot the blue enemies, and the red bullet to shoot the red ones. The game gets progressively more difficult, the longer you survive.
